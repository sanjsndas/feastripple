                    <p>Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain until their expiration date or until deleted. Essential cookies typically last from a few hours to one year. Performance cookies generally persist for 2-24 months. Functional cookies often expire after 1-12 months depending on purpose.</p>
                    <p>Advertising cookies may remain active for several months to years. Social media cookie durations are set by the respective platforms. Some third-party cookies automatically renew upon subsequent visits. We regularly review cookie durations to minimize unnecessary data retention. Expired cookies are automatically deleted from your device.</p>
                    <p>Cookie lifespans reflect their specific purposes and requirements. Security cookies have shorter durations to reduce risk. Preference cookies last longer to maintain user settings. Analytics cookies balance data usefulness with privacy considerations.

Options include accepting all cookies, blocking third-party cookies, or disabling cookies entirely. Browser settings also let you delete existing cookies. Some browsers offer per-site cookie controls for granular management.</p>
                    <p>Chrome users can access cookie settings via chrome://settings/cookies. Firefox provides detailed cookie management in Preferences > Privacy & Security. Safari allows cookie blocking through Preferences > Privacy. Edge offers cookie controls under Settings > Site Permissions. Opera includes cookie management in Settings > Privacy & Security.</p>
                    <p>Blocking all cookies may prevent some websites from working properly. Many sites require certain cookies for basic functionality.

                    <p>The tool complies with GDPR and CCPA requirements. It doesn't load non-essential cookies until consent is given. Withdrawal of consent stops further processing of affected cookies. Existing cookies remain until their expiration or manual deletion.

                    <p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser setting that signals your privacy preference. When enabled, your browser sends a DNT header with web requests. We honor DNT signals by disabling non-essential tracking cookies. Essential cookies required for site operation will still be set.</p>
                    <p>DNT doesn't automatically block all cookies or tracking technologies. Implementation varies across websites as no formal standard exists.

                    <p>Industry programs offer centralized opt-out mechanisms for advertising cookies. The Digital Advertising Alliance provides YourAdChoices (optout.aboutads.info). Network Advertising Initiative offers an opt-out tool (optout.networkadvertising.org). These affect participating companies but not all advertisers.</p>
                    <p>Google provides an Analytics opt-out browser add-on. Facebook offers ad preference management in account settings. Many ad networks provide individual opt-out mechanisms. These tools typically work by setting an opt-out cookie on your device. Clearing cookies may require repeating the opt-out process.</p>
                    <p>For email tracking, disable automatic image loading in your email client. Use browser extensions that block tracking pixels. Consider privacy-focused browsers that limit tracking by default. Mobile devices offer advertising ID resets in system settings. VPNs and private browsing modes provide additional privacy layers.</p>

                    <p>Mobile operating systems provide cookie management through browser settings. iOS allows cookie blocking in Settings > Safari > Privacy & Security. Android offers controls in Chrome's Site Settings. Both platforms let you clear cookies and browsing data system-wide.</p>
                    <p>Mobile apps may use similar tracking technologies to cookies. iOS provides App Tracking Transparency framework for control. Android offers opt-out of ads personalization in Google settings. Reset your advertising ID periodically to disrupt tracking profiles. Review app permissions to limit unnecessary data access.</p>
                    <p>Tablet devices follow similar controls to their smartphone counterparts. Some mobile browsers offer enhanced privacy features by default. Consider using private browsing modes on shared devices. Be cautious when allowing "remember me" options on mobile browsers. Mobile operating systems are adding more granular privacy controls with each update.</p>

                    <h4>5.1 Web Beacons/Pixel Tags</h4>
                    <p>Web beacons are tiny transparent images embedded in web pages or emails. Also called pixel tags or clear GIFs, they track user interactions. When loaded, they can record page views, email opens, or ad impressions. Beacons often work with cookies to enhance tracking capabilities. They're commonly used in marketing campaigns and analytics.</p>
                    <p>We use pixels for conversion tracking and campaign measurement. They help determine if ads lead to desired actions. Email pixels track open rates to improve communication strategies. Some pixels facilitate retargeting across different websites. Unlike cookies, beacons can't be blocked through browser settings alone.</p>
                    <p>Blocking images in emails prevents open tracking. Browser extensions can detect and block tracking pixels. Privacy-focused email clients often disable remote images by default. Some analytics providers offer pixel-less alternatives using JavaScript. We minimize pixel use to essential marketing performance measurement.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="policy-point">
                    <h4>5.2 Local Storage</h4>
                    <p>Local Storage (HTML5 Web Storage) provides larger client-side storage than cookies. It persists after browser closure and has no expiration date. Data remains until explicitly cleared by user or website. We use localStorage for caching large preference sets and offline functionality. It's more efficient than cookies for storing non-sensitive data.</p>
                    <p>Common uses include saving complex UI states and application data. Local Storage can improve performance by reducing server requests. Unlike cookies, data isn't transmitted with each HTTP request. Storage limits are much higher (typically 5-10MB per domain). Data is only accessible to pages from the same origin.</p>
                    <p>You can clear Local Storage through browser developer tools. Some privacy extensions automatically purge storage data. Private browsing modes typically don't persist Local Storage. We only use it for legitimate functional purposes, not tracking. Data is encrypted when containing sensitive information.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="policy-point">
                    <h4>5.3 IndexedDB</h4>
                    <p>IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data. It enables offline functionality for web applications. We use it to cache product catalogs and user-generated content. IndexedDB supports indexing for high-performance searches. It's more powerful than Local Storage for complex data needs.</p>
                    <p>Progressive Web Apps rely on IndexedDB for offline operation. It can store files and blobs in addition to structured data. Storage limits are typically 50% of available disk space. Data persists until explicitly cleared or the storage limit is reached. We implement automatic cleanup of stale IndexedDB data.</p>
                    <p>IndexedDB data is origin-scoped like Local Storage. Clearing site data through browser settings removes IndexedDB content. Some browsers allow inspecting stored data through developer tools. We encrypt sensitive information before storage. IndexedDB usage follows the same consent requirements as cookies.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="policy-point">
                    <h4>5.4 Service Workers</h4>
                    <p>Service Workers are scripts that run in the background, separate from web pages. They enable features like push notifications and offline caching. We use them to improve performance through resource caching. Service Workers can intercept network requests for advanced functionality. They're fundamental to Progressive Web App technology.</p>
                    <p>Cached assets reduce load times for return visitors. Offline mode provides basic functionality without internet access. Background sync allows deferred actions until connection resumes. Push notifications require explicit user permission. Service Workers have no access to DOM but can communicate with pages.</p>
                    <p>You can manage Service Workers through browser developer tools. Clearing site data typically unregisters Service Workers. Some browsers show active Service Workers in settings. We only register Service Workers for legitimate performance purposes. They operate independently of cookie consent but respect privacy preferences.</p>

                    <h4>6.2 CCPA Compliance</h4>
                    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants specific rights regarding cookies. California residents can opt-out of "sale" of personal information. Under CCPA, some cookie-based data sharing may constitute a sale. We provide a clear "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link. Opt-out requests are honored within 45 days.</p>
                    <p>Our systems track CCPA opt-outs to prevent covered sharing. We don't discriminate against users who exercise CCPA rights. Verified requests can access cookie-related data collected in past 12 months. Deletion requests extend to personal information from cookies.

                <div class="policy-point">
                    <h4>6.3 ePrivacy Directive</h4>
                    <p>The EU ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law) requires prior consent for non-essential cookies. We implement strict opt-in for all cookies except strictly necessary ones. Consent must be obtained before setting any tracking cookies. Banner design follows best practices for clarity and accessibility. Rejecting cookies must be as easy as accepting them.</p>
                    <p>We provide detailed information about each cookie's purpose. Settings allow granular control by cookie category. Consent is renewed annually or when cookie usage changes significantly. The banner reappears if cookie preferences are reset. We maintain records of consent for regulatory compliance.</p>

                    <h4>6.4 International Considerations</h4>
                    <p>Cookie laws vary significantly across jurisdictions. We tailor practices to meet regional requirements. GDPR standards are applied globally as our baseline. Additional protections are implemented for stricter regulations. Local legal counsel advises on country-specific obligations.</p>
                    <p>Brazil's LGPD requires specific cookie consent mechanisms. South Africa's POPIA mandates secure cookie data handling. Canada's PIPEDA necessitates meaningful consent for tracking. Australia's Privacy Act includes cookie-related protections. We monitor emerging regulations worldwide to maintain compliance.</p>
